# Sign Up Form Website

This is a site meant to showcase intermediate HTML and CSS abilites through a Sign-up form, being part of The Odin Project curriculum.

It was created mostly to serve as a demo and learning experience to form validation and styling, as well as more advanced concepts in front-end programming. This means that nothing here is real: the site doesn't do anything when you submit the form. It also currently does not support mobile devices.

This was a very nice project for me to work on, as someone who never got along well with HTML and CSS. Learning some more advanced concepts is definitively getting me to appreciate it more, as well as feel more confortable working on the front-end. I mostly followed the design provided by The Odin Project curriculum, but with a few twists on my own, which i dare say turned out pretty well.
